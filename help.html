            <h1>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to play checkers:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up the board - The checkers board has 64 squares, alternating between dark and light colors. Place the checkers pieces on the dark squares, with each player having 12 pieces. Make sure each player's pieces are on the three rows closest to them.</li>
            <li>Decide who goes first - Either choose randomly or let the player with the dark pieces go first. </li>
            <li>Move pieces - Players take turns moving one piece at a time. Pieces always move diagonally and only on the dark squares. Regular pieces can only move forward, while kings (pieces that reach the other side) can move both forward and backward. </li>
            <li>Make a regular move - Move a piece one space diagonally forward to an adjacent empty dark square. </li>
            <li>Make a jump - You must jump an opponent's piece if possible. To jump, move your piece diagonally over your opponent's piece and land on the empty square beyond it. Remove the opponent's piece that was jumped.</li>
            <li>Become a king - If your regular piece reaches the farthest row on the other side of the board, crown it by adding another piece on top of it. This piece is now a king.</li>
            <li>Win - A player wins by jumping and removing all of the opponent's pieces or by blocking them so they cannot make any valid moves. If neither side can force a win, the game is a draw.</li>
            <li>Set up a new game - Turn the board around and switch sides, with the player who just lost going first.</li>
        </ul>
